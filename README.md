* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on JS projects 
* 📫 How to reach me chidike.henry@gmail.com

## Introduction
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate my abilities in creating a frontend application for a calculator that renders calculations after taking  in inputs and operands with ReactJS
This project will allow you to assess my proficiency in fronted development, javascript, ReactJS, and my problem-solving approach.

## Technologies Used
* ReactJS
* Javascript
* npm
* HTML
* CSS

## Project Description: 

A- Create HTML page with the following React components:
● 1- Header: shows a nice banner image
● 2- Footer: shows your name and copyright
● 3- Main body: ask the user to enter two values and choose an operation from: +,
-, *, /, ** then show the next component base on the user selection
● 4- Sub body: a component to the operation results with description such as “2.5 *
2 = 5.0” if the user choose multiplication , or “2.5 + 2 = 4.5” if the user choose
addition
● Note: You may need to put the state variables in a parent component to be
shares between the 2 children body components

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
