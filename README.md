* 📫 How to reach me chidike.henry@gmail.com

## Introduction
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate my abilities in creating a backend application for a conversational bot that confirms flight bookings.
This project will allow you to assess my proficiency in backend development, API integration, and my problem-solving approach.

## Technologies Used
* ReactJS
* Javascript
* npm
* HTML
* CSS

## Project Description: 

A- Create HTML page with the following React components:
● 1- Header: shows a nice banner image
● 2- Footer: shows your name and copyright
● 3- Main body: ask the user to enter two values and choose an operation from: +,
-, *, /, ** then show the next component base on the user selection
● 4- Sub body: a component to the operation results with description such as “2.5 *
2 = 5.0” if the user choose multiplication , or “2.5 + 2 = 4.5” if the user choose
addition
● Note: You may need to put the state variables in a parent component to be
shares between the 2 children body components

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
